;;; paredit-viper-compat.el: viper-mode modifications to support paredit
;;
;; Copyright (c) 2009, Jeremy L. Rayman. 2011, Martial Boniou
;; Author: Jeremy Rayman
;; Maintainer: Martial Boniou
;; URL:  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/paredit-viper-compat.el
;; Site: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEditViperCompat
;; Status: Beta - partially tested version for github/martialboniou/Dots.git .

;; This mode allows paredit to work when viper is enabled.
;;
;; Usage:
;; Place the following in your .emacs (or init.el):
;;
;; (eval-after-load 'paredit
;;   '(progn
;;      (require 'paredit-viper-compat)
;;      (add-hook 'paredit-mode-hook #'paredit-viper-compat))
;;
;; NOTE: the (require ...) line may be omitted if you register 
;;       PAREDIT-VIPER-COMPAT's autoloads in your loaddefs:
;; <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/elisp/html_node/Autoload.html>
;;
;; You may need customizations:
;; (add-hook 'paredit-mode-hook #'(lambda ()
;;                  (paredit-viper-compat)
;;                                  ;; ... customization ...
;;                                ))
;;
;; This will apply the paredit-viper-compat fixes only when paredit
;; is active.
;;
;; User key customizations:
;; If you want to add your own keybindings in addition to the ones
;; provided by paredit-viper-compat, you can do so using
;; the function paredit-viper-add-local-keys.
;; Usage is (paredit-viper-add-local-keys STATE KEYS);
;; where STATE is one of 'all-states, 'vi-state, 'insert-state, or 'emacs-state.
;; Insert a statement like the following inside the HOOK function
;; form above:
;;
;; (paredit-viper-add-local-keys 'all-states  ; or 'insert-state, etc.
;;                               '(("\C-w" . paredit-backward-kill-word)
;;                                 ;; ... more keys ...
;;                                 ))
;;
;; Complete setup combining the above examples:
;;
;; (add-hook 'paredit-mode-hook #'(lambda ()
;;                                  (progn
;;                                    (require 'paredit-viper-compat)
;;                                    (paredit-viper-compat)
;;                                    (paredit-viper-add-local-keys 'all-states
;;                                      '(("\C-w" . paredit-backward-kill-word)
;;                                        ;; ... more keys ...
;;                                        ))))))
;;
;; Changelog:
;; 0.1a - 2011-10-20 - Fix.
;; 0.1  - 2009-08-15 - Initial release.
;;
;; TODO:
;; * XEmacs compatibility - paredit uses a variable `paredit-forward-delete-keys'
;;   which provides different values for GNU Emacs vs XEmacs. I could
;;   not figure out how to use that value correctly in the code below,
;;   so ended up hardcoding the values for GNU Emacs ("<delete>" and
;;   "<deletechar>").

;; Extra notes about how this all works:
;;
;; Emacs minor modes are all listed in `minor-mode-map-alist', and
;; when the keys from two minor modes overlap, the keybinding from the
;; minor mode at the front of the list is preferred.
;;
;; However, Viper maintains its own separate hierarchy of minor
;; modes. It turns out Viper is implemented as a whole series of minor
;; modes which give you the various states - insert mode, vi-mode,
;; etc. This list is stored in a separate `emulation-mode-map-alists',
;; which takes priority over the keybindings of all the minor modes in
;; the regular `minor-mode-map-alist'.
;;
;; So that's why we were getting a collision. Viper-mode was getting
;; priority over paredit's keybindings.
;;
;; Viper provides a couple empty keymaps for users to customize which
;; let you set your own keybindings. You can set them on a mode-local
;; basis, i.e. only in effect when paredit is enabled. You just add a
;; hook on load of paredit-mode that sets the right keybindings.  -
;;
;; (Actually, you have to use viper-add-local-keys to add keys, not
;; insert the bindings into these maps directly. That's why the keys are
;; all in an alist instead of being added to a mode-map: viper wants
;; an alist).
;;
;; viper-add-local-keys - per-buffer keybinding modification which
;; overshadows the viper keybindings. Accepts an alist.
;; Fills in some empty keymaps set aside by viper for user
;; customizations.
;;
;; - minor-mode-map-alist and emulation-mode-map-alists:
;; emulation-mode-map-alists takes precedence over
;; minor-mode-map-alist, which is why you don't see paredit's
;; keybindings "winning" in the precedence order. Paredit is first in
;; minor-mode-map-alist, so its key bindings override other minor
;; modes, but that still doesn't fix things because viper uses
;; `emulation-mode-map-alists' which has precedence over the entire
;; minor-mode-map-alist hierarchy.
