;;; chop.el -- Interactive binary search for a line within a window.
;;; Written by Luke Gorrie <luke@bluetail.com>. Version 1.0, May 2002.
;;; Probably only works in GNU Emacs 21.

;; Interactively-driven binary search to move the point to a
;; particular line on the screen, by successive choppings in half.

;; Setup:
;;
;; Bind move-chop-{up,down} to keys. Otherwise they probably won't
;; work right, since M-x mucks with `last-command'.

;; Instructions:
;;
;; Use the following algorithm to move to any visible line in O(log N)
;; steps for a window N lines high:
;;
;; 1. Choose a line, L.
;; 2. Press either UP or DOWN. This starts by moving the point to the center.
;; 3. Repeat until L is the current line (or close enough):
;;      If L is above the point, press UP. Otherwise press DOWN.
;;
;; In practice, a few chops usually gets you pretty close. Then you
;; can zero in with line/paragraph/defun-based motion.
