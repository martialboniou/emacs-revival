* Emacs revival site-lisp

Keep track of useful emacs lisp files that may not be easy to find via ELPA or el-get or untracked on version-based server (github, googlecode...).

** Install

Move your cursor to any point of the source line and run ~C-c C-c~ to byte-compile *emacs-revival*. Change the ~SITE-LISP-PATH~ variable if your path to your personal site-lisp is not the default one.

#+source: install
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var site-lisp-path="~/.emacs.d/vendor"
(let ((load-path-keeper (copy-sequence load-path))
      (default-directory site-lisp-path))
  (setq load-path
    (append (let ((load-path load-path-keeper))
      (append (copy-sequence (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path '(".")))
      (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path))) load-path))
  (let ((dir (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))))
    (add-to-list 'load-path dir)
    (prog1
        (byte-recompile-directory dir 0 t)
      (setq load-path load-path-keeper)))))
#+end_src

You may run this script from a fresh emacs by ~C-c C-c~-ing the following snippet:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((file-name (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
  (shell-command-to-string (format "cd %s;emacs -q %s" (file-name-directory file-name)
                                                       (file-name-nondirectory file-name))))
#+end_src
