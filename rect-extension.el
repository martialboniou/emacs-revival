;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Some extensions for rect.el
;;
;; Have some nice functions:
;;      `execute-command-with-region' can execute command with region
;;      or rectangle, and then return result.
;;
;;      `execute-command-with-region-replace' can execute command with
;;      region or rectangle and replace original one.
;;
;;      `execute-command-with-region-kill' like `execute-command-with-region-replace',
;;      different is use kill action instead replace action.
;;
;;      `mark-rectangle-to-end' will mark rectangle to the longest column
;;      in current rectangle.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put rect-extension.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'rect-extension)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Change log:
