;;; Commentary:

;; Description:
;; ------------
;; cycle-buffer is yet another way of selecting buffers. Instead of prompting
;; you for a buffer name, cycle-buffer switches to the most recently used
;; buffer, and repeated invocations of cycle-buffer-forward switch to less
;; recently visited buffers. If you accidentally overshoot, calling
;; cycle-buffer-backward goes back. You should issue consecutive cycle command
;; pretty quickly: if there is some intervening command between two cycling
;; commands, or if a settable timeout expires, the cycling is reset and the
;; next cycle-buffer will get you to the last buffer.
;;
;; I find this to be the fastest buffer-switching mechanism; it's like C-x
;; b <return> w/out the return, but it's not limited to the most recently
;; accessed buffer.  Plus you never have to remember buffer names; you
;; just keep cycling until you recognize the buffer you're searching for. The
;; buffer ring is shown in the echo area centered around the current buffer;
;; if you see the name of the buffer you are looking for a few positions away
;; from the center, you can give an argument to cycle-buffer to get directly
;; to it. Positive arguments move to the right, negative arguments to the
;; left.
;;
;; In addition to cycling forward and backward, there are two versions of the
;; command provided: normal and "permissive". The permissive version allows
;; (as per factory settings) buffers of the form *bufname*, while the normal
;; version does not.

;; Installation:
;; -------------
;; Add these lines in your .emacs:
;;   (autoload 'cycle-buffer "cycle-buffer" "Cycle forward." t)
;;   (autoload 'cycle-buffer-backward "cycle-buffer" "Cycle backward." t)
;;   (autoload 'cycle-buffer-permissive "cycle-buffer" "Cycle forward allowing *buffers*." t)
;;   (autoload 'cycle-buffer-backward-permissive "cycle-buffer" "Cycle backward allowing *buffers*." t)
;;   (autoload 'cycle-buffer-toggle-interesting "cycle-buffer" "Toggle if this buffer will be considered." t)
;;   (global-set-key [(f9)]        'cycle-buffer-backward)
;;   (global-set-key [(f10)]       'cycle-buffer)
;;   (global-set-key [(shift f9)]  'cycle-buffer-backward-permissive)
;;   (global-set-key [(shift f10)] 'cycle-buffer-permissive)
;; You may want to adjust the keyboard bindings to suit your taste. See below
;; for other customisable variables.

;; Todo
;; ----
;; - try not to shift the list in the echo area, move the [ ] only.
;; - in order not to switch to the intermediate buffers, implement an electric
;;   minibuffer mode where cycle-buffer and cycle-buffer-backward only scroll
;;   the buffer list in the minibuffer, and the buffer is switched only upon
;;   exit from that mode (partly suggested by terry@santafe.edu)
;; SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOME.

;; floatp-safe is not defined in emacs, pointed by tim@ipac.caltech.edu
;;
;; Sat Jun  8 17:27:57 1996 [VA]
;; alex.lefaive@Eng.Sun.COM suggested an "inverse" of cycle-buffer-ignore, a
;; variable that would only *allow* certain buffers. I decided to generalise
;; the two to cycle-buffer-filter, a general and-or form.

;;
;; Mon Jun 10 11:55:25 1996 [VA]

;;
;; Mon Mar 24 14:54:37 1997 [Martin Stjernholm <mast@lysator.liu.se>]

;; to the buffer list caused by buffers we just fly through.
;;
;; Wed May 21 02:29:18 1997 [VA]
;; cycle-buffer-message: don't log the buffer list onto the message log

You can add more restrictions by consing to the variable from inside
cycle-buffer-load-hook or after (require 'cycle-buffer). For example to
restrict switching from a C++ file only to relevant files, do this:
  (setq cycle-buffer-filter (cons
